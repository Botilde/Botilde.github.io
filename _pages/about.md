I'm a first year undergraduate student from [School of EECS](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), majored in integrated circuit design and integrated systems. At the same time, I studied for a double degree in economics at the National School of Development.

Although I didn't have the opportunity to majore in computer science, I will teach myself, learn from others and take the opportunity to explore and enrich myself about this aspect. Looking forward to making progress together~ <!--My research interest includes computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning, and computational photography.-->
